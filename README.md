# Flashcard project 
About
Simple flashcard app that converts JSON files with 3 fields into card decks. First field is question (card front) while second two fields are card back (answer). 
Does some minor font scaling based on text length, but isn't perfect. 
To create a new deck, just create a folder with your JSON file under the local .\Card Decks folder.
